    			<h4>About</h4><hr/>
    				<p>I'm a PhD Candidate in Political Science and <a
       				 href="https://bdss.la.psu.edu/">Social Data Analytics</a> at the
    				Pennsylvania State University. I study international conflicts escalation, foreign policy, human rights, and I am interested in machine learning methods and text analysis with application to political and social information.
    				My dissertation looks at the effect of hawkishness of political leaders on conflict escalation.
